You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with <code>O(1)</code> extra memory.<br><br><br>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["o","l","l","e","h"]</pre>
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]

- <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code><br>
- <code>s[i]</code> is a printable ascii character.`,

When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.<br><br><br>

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.`,

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.`,

Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first. If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become <code>0</code>, then that player loses. The bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is <code>0</code>.<br><br>

Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to <code>0</code>, then that player wins.<br><br><br>

Return <code>true</code> if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.`,
